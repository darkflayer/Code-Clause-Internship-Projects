# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The goal is to segment customers based on their purchase behavior 
to better understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkflayer/Code-Clause-Internship-Projects/Customer-Segmentation.git
cd repository

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the K-Means clustering analysis, execute the following script:

```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes customer purchase data. It can be found in the `data/` directory.

- `Mall_Customer.csv`: Contains customer purchase information.

You can also use your own dataset by ensuring it matches the required format.

## Implementation

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying relevant features for clustering.
3. **Clustering**: Applying K-Means clustering to segment customers.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of the clusters and visualizing the results.

## Results

The K-Means clustering resulted in several distinct customer segments. 

Example visualizations of clusters:

- Cluster distribution plot
- Centroid visualization

For detailed results, refer to the `results/` directory.
